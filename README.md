# Robot-Vision
Code from Robot Vision class at MSU Bozeman. 
Assignments 3 - 6 were team projects, THe first one, assignment 3, my partner dropped out and i ended up doing the assignment myself.

The group assignments 4, 5 ,6 . One of our teammate disappeared, after a few weeks he said he was in Kyiv, 
(AS IN KYIV UKRAINE), so we ended up turning in assignment 4 and 5 late, which if we would have gotten those assignments in on time we would have had an A in this class. Since we got 100% on them, we just got docked for lateness (I also had Covid during assignment 4)

I forgot to get the code we used for those assignments, but I asked my teammate and hopefully he saved them since they where on the Audrino board.

Good times.
